# GLSL Editor App
Cross-platform GLSL editor application created with [glslEditor](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslEditor) and [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron).  

Currently the app is simply a submodule wrapped in an Electron shell. This is an attempt to keep development of the editor in the primary repository, but this process may change.

## Usage

```sh
# Run the app for testing.
npm run start

# Package the app for the local operating system.
npm run package-local

# Package the app for all operating systems.
npm run package-all
```

## Todo

- [ ] Fix export to artwork URL
- [ ] Find workaround for modal popout window
